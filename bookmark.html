Early life
Dhanush was born as Venkatesh Prabhu Kasthuri Raja[17] on 28 July 1983 to Tamil film director and producer, Kasthuri Raja, and his wife, Vijayalakshmi, in Madras, Tamil Nadu.[18] Initially he wished to study Hotel Management and become a chef.[19] However his elder brother, film director Selvaraghavan, pressured him to become an actor.[20][21] Dhanush also has two sisters named Vimalageetha and Karthiga Karthik.[22]

Acting career
2002–2010: Career beginnings
Venkatesh Prabhu adopted the screen name "Dhanush" after being inspired by the fictional covert operation from Kuruthipunal (1995).[23] He debuted in the 2002 teen drama film Thulluvadho Ilamai, directed by his father Kasthuri Raja, which became a sleeper hit. He then appeared in his brother Selvaraghavan's first directorial venture, the romantic psychological thriller Kaadhal Kondein in 2003. The film portrayed Dhanush as a mentally-disturbed youth, Vinodh, who yearned for the love of his friend, eventually turning possessive of her. Upon release, the film opened to critical acclaim and proved to be a major commercial success, eventually becoming Dhanush's breakthrough in Tamil cinema.[24] The film also fetched him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. His next film was the romantic comedy Thiruda Thirudi (2003), a critical and commercial success.[25]

In 2004, Dhanush appeared in Pudhukottaiyilirundhu Saravanan and Sulaan.[26][27] Later, he also appeared in Dreams, another film panned by critics.[28] The film was directed by his father, like their previous ventures. In 2005, Dhanush appeared in Devathaiyai Kanden and in the same year, he also worked on Balu Mahendra's Adhu Oru Kana Kaalam.[29] Though it was a commercial disaster at the box office, Dhanush has repeatedly stated that he started taking acting seriously only after working with Mahendra.

In 2006, he reunited with his brother for the cult gangster film, Pudhupettai.[30] It portrayed a young man's journey from a street urchin to gangster, receiving mixed reviews, initially, though Dhanush's performance received major praise. However, over the years, the film has undergone a critical re-evaluation and is now considered to be one of the greatest Tamil films ever made, whilst also garnering a huge cult following.[31] Dhanush subsequently received his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil, for his performance in the film. That same year, he also reunited with Boopathy Pandian after Devathaiyai Kanden, for the romantic comedy, Thiruvilaiyaadal Aarambam, opposite Shriya Saran and Prakash Raj.[32][33] It was a major commercial success, a first for Dhanush, after several average and below-average grossers.

Dhanush's first release of 2007, Parattai Engira Azhagu Sundaram did not do well at the box office.[34] The film was a remake of the successful Kannada language film Jogi (2005). However, his second film Polladhavan was released during Diwali 2007. Polladhavan was based on the 1948–Italian neorealist film Bicycle Thieves and Dhanush's performance was appreciated.[35]

The following year, the remake of a Telugu film directed by his brother formed the plot line for Dhanush's next film directed by debutant Mithran Jawahar, later titled Yaaradi Nee Mohini.[36] The romantic comedy proved to be a major critical and commercial success, thus earning Dhanush his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. He later appeared in a cameo appearance, for his father-in-law Rajinikanth's venture Kuselan. His subsequent venture was Suraj's Padikathavan, which was released in January 2009.[37] His performance was praised and well received.[38] His next two films Kutty and Uthama Puthiran, were both collaborations with director Mithran Jawahar.[39]

The song "Un Mele Aasaidhaan" from the action-adventure film Aayirathil Oruvan, which featured him alongside his then wife Aishwarya Rajinikanth, won him his first Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer – Tamil.

In 1999, Babu made his debut as a lead actor with the romantic comedy Rajakumarudu, and people began referring to him with the title Prince.[18] For his performance, he received the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[19] He starred in two films the following year – Yuvaraju and Vamsi.[citation needed] He also starred in Krishna Vamsi's Murari (2001) which he regarded as an important film in his career and the role he played in it one of his favourites.[20][failed verification][21] For his role in Murari, he earned a Nandi Special Jury Award, in addition to his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[19]

In 2002, his performance in Takkari Donga landed him his second Nandi Special Jury Award.[19] He had two film releases in 2003, the first one being Gunasekhar's Okkadu co-starring Bhumika Chawla.[22] He won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[23] The other release was Nijam co-starring Rakshita.[24] Babu received praise from critics for his performance in the film, with Vijayalaxmi of Rediff.com calling him the only reason to watch the film's second half which she termed "a routine tale of vendetta".[25] He won his first Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film, in addition to his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[26]

Mainstream film (2004–2010)
In 2004, Manjula produced his next film,[citation needed] Naani, directed by S. J. Surya co-starring Amisha Patel. While its simultaneously shot Tamil version New featuring a different cast proved to be commercially successful, Naani flopped at the box office.[20][non-primary source needed] He received his third Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in his next film, Arjun, directed by Gunasekhar and produced by Ramesh.[27] The film released on 18 August 2004[28] and was successful at the box-office.[29] The film was screened at the International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section. This was Keerthi Reddy's final acting performance prior to her retirement from the film industry.[30] He chose to act in Trivikram Srinivas's Athadu (2005), co-starring Trisha Krishnan, whose script had been approved back in 2002 before the production of Naani and Arjun had begun.[31][non-primary source needed] It emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.[32][33] The film proved to be a major boost for Babu's career as he received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu, in addition to fetching his second Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the role of a hired assassin.[34] The movie collected a share of ₹22 crores at the box office.[citation needed] Idlebrain.com gave it a rating of 3.25/5 and mentioned Mahesh Babu is stylish and brilliant as professional killer.[35]Cinegoer.net gave a review stating, "True the film gives an image of a Hollywood base for the drama. Even the taking, screenplay structure and execution of scenes, less talk and more action.[36]

He then collaborated with Puri Jagannadh in 2006 for the film Pokiri, which was jointly produced by Jagannadh and Manjula.[37] He received high praise for his performance, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu opining that "Mahesh's understated performance in Pokiri allows him effortlessly to reclaim the title of a star, overshadowing his questionable career choices of late".[37] He won his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[38] That same year, his next film, Sainikudu, was released.[39] A critic from Rediff.com wrote that "Nonetheless, Sainikudu can be watched at least for its premise of letting the warrior in each individual surface, and the fact that it is done with the idea of motivating people to do something for their fellow humans".[40]

The following year saw Babu acting in the film Athidhi, co-starring Amrita Rao, marking her Telugu debut. The film was produced by Mahesh Babu's's brother Ramesh.[41] UTV Motion Pictures acquired the film's distribution rights for ₹18.5 crore, which became its first Telugu film venture.[42] Jeevi of Idlebrain.com praised the film's first half while criticising the last thirty minutes of the film.[43] A critic from Rediff.com wrote that the film "is built up through a 'racy' screenplay which is gripping to an extent, but stretches to three long hours".[44] In 2008, Babu provided voice-over for the film Jalsa directed by Trivikram Srinivas.[45]

After Athidhi's release, Babu took a break from films for seven months; two months later, he signed Khaleja, but the break was unintentionally extended for two years due to several delays. During this time, Babu's grandmother and his wife Namrata's parents died. Krishna was worried about Babu's career as the film's shoot was delayed for so long.[46] The film deals with illegal-mining in India, and related environmental damage.[47] It marks Babu's return as an actor after a three-year hiatus in his second collaboration with Trivikram after Athadu.

Upon release, Khaleja received mixed reviews from critics and was a commercial failure in India.[48] However, it managed to perform well at the overseas box office becoming the highest grossing Telugu film at that time.[49] Rediff gave a 3 out of 5 rating and noted "The duo of Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is watchable, entertaining with good humour, couple of well-orchestrated action sequences and songs and with a bit to take home as well. It's Mahesh's show all the way, much to the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the soul of the movie, be it his dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or emotions, he is effortless.[50] The film is included in the list of "25 Greatest Telugu Films Of The Decade" by Film Companion.[51]
